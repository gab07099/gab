   <h2 id="c1">Bawat Piyesa</h2>
   <p>Bawat ngiti, bawat luha
Bawat gising, bawat pikit
Bawat hangin na tinatanggap
Bawat buga
At habang ika'y yinayakap nang maigi
Binubulong ang dalanging 'wag sana maglaho sa hangin
Ang bawat piyesa na bumubuo sa 'yo
Bawat piyesang nawa'y mapasaakin habang-buhay
Dito ka na lang habang-buhay
Dito ka na lang habang-buhay
Dito ka na lang habang-buhay
Habang-buhay
Oh, ang init ng iyong balat
At bawat sinulid ng iyong buhok
Dumadaan ang ilaw sa mga bulsa't
Dumarating sa akin
At habang ika'y yinayakap nang maigi
Binubulong ang dalanging huwag sana maglaho sa hangin
Ang bawat piyesa na bumubuo sa 'yo
Bawat piyesang nawa'y mapasaakin habang-buhay
Dito ka na lang habang-buhay
Dito ka na lang habang-buhay
Dito ka na lang habang-buhay
Habang-buhay
Huwag kang bibitaw, huwag kang mawawala
Oh, aking dinadala ang bawat piyesa ng ikaw
Ano'ng gagawin kung wala ka?
Ano'ng gagawin kung wala ka?
Ano'ng gagawin kung wala ka?
Kung wala ka?
Dito ka na lang habang-buhay
Dito ka na lang habang-buhay
Dito ka na lang habang-buhay
Habang-buhay
Habang-buhay
Habang-buhay
Habang-buhay
Habang-buhay</p>

<h2 id="c2">Promise (laufey)</h2>
<p>I made a promise
To distance myself
Took a flight, through aurora skies
Honestly, I didn't think about
How we didn't say goodbye
Just see you very soon
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you, mmm
So I didn't call you
For sixteen long days
And I should get a cigarette
For so much restraint
No matter how long I resist temptation
I will always lose
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you
I've done the math
There's no solution
We'll never last
Why can't I let go of this?
So I broke my promise
I called you last night
I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have
If it weren't for the sight of a boy
Who looked just like you
Standing out on Melrose Avenue
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you, mmm
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you </p>

<h2 id="c3">505 (Artic Monkeys)</h2>
<p>I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs
Stop and wait a sec'
Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure is such a perfect place to start
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs
But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile</p>
